# Movie Lister

This is a sample app to demonstrate writing your own Swift API Client library.

It uses the [TheMovieDB API](https://https://developers.themoviedb.org/3) to fetch popular movies, sign in, and favorite/unfavorite movies.

## Swift for Good

This was written as a chapter for Swift for Good, a book about Swift where all proceeds go to charity. You can [find the book here](https://swiftforgood.com).
